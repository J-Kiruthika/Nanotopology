# Nanotopology
The project checks the similarity of two graphs using nano sets.

## Nanotopology.py file is used to find nanosets 
1. Input for Function vh is list of vertices of graph
2. Inputs for Function lower_approximation and upper_approximation is dictionary and value returns from function vh. 
   Dictionaty should contain vertices of graph as key and corresponding adjacent elemensts as value.
   
3. Input for boundary_region is value returned from lower-approximation and upper_approximation.   
4. Nanoset is obtained by passing values return from lower-approximation, upper_approximation and boundary_region.
